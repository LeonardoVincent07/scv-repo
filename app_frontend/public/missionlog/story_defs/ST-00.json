  "body_markdown": "# Provide Basic Backend API Availability\n\n## Statement\nAs a platform owner, I want a basic backend API to be available so that the system can support the incremental delivery of client data capabilities in a controlled and extensible way.\n\n## Description\nThis story establishes the foundational backend capability on which the entire platform depends. It confirms that the backend application is not merely runnable, but correctly structured to support enterprise-grade delivery across ingestion, processing, audit, and exposure use cases.\n\nThe backend will be implemented using a modern service architecture, with clear separation between routing, service logic, persistence, and configuration. Core infrastructure concerns such as application startup, dependency wiring, configuration loading, and error handling are to be validated.\n\nThe backend exposes initial API endpoints to demonstrate:\n- request handling and routing\n- structured request/response models\n- consistent error behaviour\n- environment-driven configuration\n- health and readiness signalling\n\nPersistence wired using the real database layer, ensuring that subsequent stories operate against a genuine persistence mechanism rather than mocks or stubs. This confirms that the backend is capable of supporting real data flows, controlled schema evolution, and transactional behaviour.\n\nThis story also validates that the backend can be:\n- started locally in a development environment\n- exercised via automated tests\n- extended incrementally by subsequent stories without rework\n\nAll subsequent backend stories assume this capability as a prerequisite.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** the backend application is started locally or in a deployed environment  \n  **When** a basic API endpoint is invoked  \n  **Then** the backend responds successfully with a structured response\n\n- **Given** the backend application is running  \n  **When** a health or readiness endpoint is accessed  \n  **Then** the application reports itself as available and correctly initialised\n\n- **Given** the backend configuration is invalid or incomplete  \n  **When** the application starts  \n  **Then** failures are surfaced clearly and prevent ambiguous or silent failure\n\n- **Given** automated tests are executed  \n  **When** backend functionality is exercised  \n  **Then** the application behaves consistently across environments"
