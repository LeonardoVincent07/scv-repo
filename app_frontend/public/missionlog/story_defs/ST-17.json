  "body_markdown": "# Normalise Search Fields\n\n## Statement\nAs an operations user, I want search fields to be normalised so that client data can be searched consistently regardless of source formatting.\n\n## Description\nClient data may be represented differently across source systems, including variations in casing, formatting, and structure.  \nThe platform must normalise search-relevant fields into a consistent representation suitable for indexing and querying.\n\nNormalised search fields improve search accuracy and user experience.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** client data contains searchable attributes  \n  **When** normalisation is performed  \n  **Then** search fields are transformed into a consistent format\n\n- **Given** normalised search fields  \n  **When** indexing occurs  \n  **Then** the normalised values are used\n\n- **Given** a field cannot be normalised  \n  **When** processing occurs  \n  **Then** the limitation is reported clearly"
