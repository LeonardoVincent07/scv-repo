  "body_markdown": "# Map Identity Fields\n\n## Statement\nAs a data operations user, I want to map identity fields so that equivalent client attributes from different source systems can be normalised and compared consistently.\n\n## Description\nClient identity data may be provided by multiple source systems using different field names and structures.  \nThe platform must support mapping source-specific identity fields to a canonical representation so that identity information can be processed consistently across the platform.\n\nMapped identity fields form the basis for downstream matching, profile assembly, and lineage reporting.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** identity fields exist in a source system  \n  **When** identity field mappings are defined  \n  **Then** the fields are mapped to the platform’s canonical identity model\n\n- **Given** identity mappings are defined  \n  **When** client data is ingested  \n  **Then** identity values are normalised according to the mappings\n\n- **Given** a required identity field is unmapped  \n  **When** identity processing is attempted  \n  **Then** the issue is reported clearly"
