  "body_markdown": "# Compute Completeness\n\n## Statement\nAs a compliance or operations user, I want data completeness to be computed so that I can assess whether client profiles contain sufficient information.\n\n## Description\nClient profiles may be partially populated depending on available source data.  \nThe platform must compute completeness indicators that describe how fully populated a client profile is relative to expected attributes.\n\nCompleteness indicators support data quality monitoring and informed operational decision-making.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** a client profile exists  \n  **When** completeness is computed  \n  **Then** completeness indicators are calculated for the profile\n\n- **Given** underlying client data changes  \n  **When** completeness is recomputed  \n  **Then** indicators reflect the updated profile state\n\n- **Given** completeness cannot be fully determined  \n  **When** computation is attempted  \n  **Then** partial completeness is recorded with clear indicators"
