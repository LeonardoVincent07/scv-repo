    "description": "Assemble a canonical client base profile by reading existing client data\nfrom the persistent database and returning it in the shape defined by the\nInitial Logical Data Model.\n\nThis story covers read-only assembly of core client attributes only.\nNo matching, merging, enrichment, lineage computation, or quality scoring\nis performed as part of this story.\n",
    "acceptance_criteria": [
      "A client profile can be retrieved using an existing internal client identifier",
      "The returned profile conforms to the ClientProfile structure defined in the Initial Logical Data Model",
      "Core profile fields (e.g. name, email, country, identifiers, addresses) are populated from persisted data where available",
      "The profile assembly is deterministic and repeatable for the same input",
      "No matching, merging, enrichment, lineage, or quality logic is applied"
