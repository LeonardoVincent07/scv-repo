  "body_markdown": "# Profile API (Basic)\n\n## Statement\nAs an application or operations user, I want a basic profile API so that consolidated client profiles can be retrieved programmatically.\n\n## Description\nThe platform must expose a basic profile API that allows authorised consumers to retrieve assembled client profiles.  \nThe API provides programmatic access to the platform’s consolidated view of a client and supports integration with downstream systems and user interfaces.\n\nThe basic profile API focuses on core profile retrieval without advanced metadata or lineage detail.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** a client profile exists  \n  **When** the basic profile API is called with a valid identifier  \n  **Then** the client profile is returned successfully\n\n- **Given** a requested profile does not exist  \n  **When** the API is called  \n  **Then** a clear “not found” response is returned\n\n- **Given** invalid request parameters are provided  \n  **When** the API is called  \n  **Then** a clear error response is returned"
