  "body_markdown": "# Match Clients by Registration Number\n\n## Statement\nAs a compliance operations user, I want clients to be matched by registration number so that records referring to the same legal entity can be identified reliably.\n\n## Description\nClient records originating from different systems may refer to the same legal entity using a common registration number.  \nThe platform must support matching client records based on registration number as a strong identifier.\n\nMatching by registration number complements other matching strategies and improves the accuracy of client consolidation.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** multiple client records exist  \n  **When** matching by registration number is performed  \n  **Then** records with the same registration number are identified as potential matches\n\n- **Given** registration number matches are identified  \n  **When** downstream processing occurs  \n  **Then** those records are treated as referring to the same entity\n\n- **Given** a registration number is missing or invalid  \n  **When** matching is attempted  \n  **Then** the limitation is reported clearly"
