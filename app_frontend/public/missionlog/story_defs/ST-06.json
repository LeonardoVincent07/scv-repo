  "body_markdown": "# Ingest KYC Data\n\n## Statement\nAs a compliance operations user, I want KYC data to be ingested from approved source systems so that client due-diligence information is available for review and downstream processing.\n\n## Description\nThe platform must support ingestion of KYC data from registered KYC source systems.  \nIngested KYC data should be persisted in a controlled manner and associated with the originating source system to ensure provenance and auditability.\n\nOnce ingested, KYC data can be used for client enrichment, profile assembly, and compliance review processes.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** a KYC source system is registered  \n  **When** KYC data is ingested  \n  **Then** the data is persisted successfully and linked to the source system\n\n- **Given** ingested KYC data  \n  **When** downstream processing is performed  \n  **Then** the data is available for enrichment and profile assembly\n\n- **Given** invalid KYC records are encountered  \n  **When** ingestion is attempted  \n  **Then** valid records are stored and invalid records are reported clearly"
