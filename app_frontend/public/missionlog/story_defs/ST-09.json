  "body_markdown": "# Match Clients by Tax Identifier\n\n## Statement\nAs a compliance operations user, I want clients to be matched by tax identifier so that duplicate or related client records can be identified accurately.\n\n## Description\nClients may appear in multiple source systems with different representations.  \nThe platform must support matching client records using tax identifiers as a strong matching attribute.\n\nSuccessful matching enables consolidation of records that refer to the same real-world entity and reduces duplication in client profiles.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** multiple client records exist  \n  **When** matching by tax identifier is performed  \n  **Then** records with the same tax identifier are identified as potential matches\n\n- **Given** a tax identifier match is identified  \n  **When** client profiles are assembled  \n  **Then** matched records are treated as referring to the same client\n\n- **Given** a tax identifier is missing or invalid  \n  **When** matching is attempted  \n  **Then** the limitation is reported clearly"
