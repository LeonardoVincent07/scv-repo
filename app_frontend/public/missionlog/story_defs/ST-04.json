  "body_markdown": "# Map Identifiers\n\n## Statement\nAs a data operations user, I want to map client identifiers so that records referring to the same real-world entity can be reliably linked across systems.\n\n## Description\nDifferent source systems may represent client identifiers using different formats or naming conventions.  \nThe platform must support mapping these identifiers to a canonical identifier model so that they can be compared and used reliably for matching and consolidation.\n\nCorrect identifier mapping is essential for accurate client matching and profile assembly.\n\n## Acceptance Criteria\n- **Given** identifier fields exist in a source system  \n  **When** identifier mappings are defined  \n  **Then** identifiers are mapped to the canonical identifier model\n\n- **Given** identifier mappings are in place  \n  **When** client records are processed  \n  **Then** identifiers are available for matching logic\n\n- **Given** an identifier required for matching is missing or unmapped  \n  **When** matching is attempted  \n  **Then** the issue is surfaced clearly for investigation"
