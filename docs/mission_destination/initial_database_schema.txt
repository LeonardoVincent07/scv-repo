# Initial Database Schema (SCV)

**MissionDestination**  
**Single Client View (SCV)**

---

## 1. Purpose

This document describes the **initial physical database schema** used by the SCV application.

It defines:
- the core tables present in the MVP database
- their primary keys and relationships
- how logical entities are realised physically

This artefact is:
- storage-specific (PostgreSQL)
- descriptive of the current MVP state
- authoritative for SQL generation

It does **not** define business semantics.  
The **Initial Logical Data Model** remains the semantic authority.

---

## 2. Relationship to the Logical Data Model

- Logical entities may be realised across multiple tables
- Physical structure may evolve independently of semantics
- All schema usage must conform to the logical data model

---

## 3. Core Tables

### 3.1 `clients`

Represents the core client record and anchors the internal SCV identifier.

**Primary key**
- `client_id`

**Key columns**
- `client_id`
- `name`
- `email`
- `country`
- `created_at`
- `updated_at`

**Logical alignment**
- Canonical client identity attributes

---

### 3.2 `client_identifiers`

Stores identifiers associated with a client from upstream systems.

**Primary key**
- `id`

**Foreign keys**
- `client_id` → `clients.client_id`

**Key columns**
- `client_id`
- `system`
- `value`

**Logical alignment**
- External identifiers associated with a client

---

### 3.3 `client_addresses`

Stores address records associated with a client.

**Primary key**
- `id`

**Foreign keys**
- `client_id` → `clients.client_id`

**Key columns**
- `client_id`
- `line1`
- `line2`
- `city`
- `postcode`
- `country`
- `source`

**Logical alignment**
- Normalised address objects

---

## 4. Supporting Tables

The following tables exist in the MVP database and support additional capabilities:

### 4.1 `match_decisions`
- Stores matching outcomes and confidence scores

### 4.2 `evidence_artefacts`
- Stores evidence payloads for auditability and traceability

### 4.3 Audit tables
- Record operational and data-change events

These tables are described at a high level only; detailed usage is defined by stories.

---

## 5. Change Control

- This document reflects the current MVP schema
- Schema changes must be:
  - explicitly documented
  - reviewed for logical model alignment
- Existing behaviours must not be silently broken
