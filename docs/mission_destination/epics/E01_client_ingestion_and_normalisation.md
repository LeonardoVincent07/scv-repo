name: "Client Ingestion & Normalisation"
description: |
  This epic delivers the capability to ingest client data from multiple internal
  systems (CRM, KYC, onboarding, trading) and normalise it into a single
  canonical client model. It ensures consistent formats, data types, and field
  structures across all sources. This is the pipeline that feeds the SCV engine
  with reliable, usable data.
