# MissionFramework Element: Application Self-Healing

## Overview
Automated detection, response, and recovery from runtime anomalies using minimal MVP mechanisms.

---

## Codify
- Basic retry and circuit-breaker config defined in YAML.
- Minimal health-check contract established.

---

## Automate
- Generated services include retry wrappers and health checks.
- Monitoring hooks capture failures.

---

## Intercept
- Guardrails warn if required self-healing hooks missing.
- CI checks presence of retry/circuit-breaker configs.

---

## Prove
- MissionLog records health events and auto-recovery outcomes.
- Evidence snapshots show self-healing execution.
